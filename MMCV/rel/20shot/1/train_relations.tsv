Chemotherapy provided on average an additional 1.0 quality-adjusted life months within a restricted 2-year time period from the time of resection.
__label__noRel	Grade 3/4 neutropenia was seen in 27 patients (68%), and grade 3/4 anemia was seen in 5 patients (13%).	The median survival was 7.8 months (range, 4-11.6 months).
__label__Support	There was a significant difference between the two community locations in favour of home (+15·2, 1·3 to 29·1, P=0.033).	Patient QOL favours delivering cancer treatment in the home rather than GP surgeries.
__label__noRel	Median overall survival and progression-free survival were more favorable in the combination arm as compared with gemcitabine alone,	an advantage which did not, however, reach statistical significance (HR = 0.80; P = .15).
__label__noRel	Patients receiving the intervention demonstrated statistically significant improvement (P =.0004) in menopausal symptoms but no significant change in vitality (P =.77).	Sexual functioning was statistically significantly improved (P =.04) in the treatment group compared with the usual-care group.

Postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation treatment after curative resection for rectal cancer was needed to reduce recurrence and improve a survival rate.
__label__Support	Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated better survival for the experimental group than the control group.	The results of this study indicate that patients with gastrointestinal cancer, who undergo surgery for stomach, pancreatic, primary liver, or colorectal cancer, benefit from a formal program of psychotherapeutic support during the inpatient hospital stay in terms of long-term survival.

__label__Support	Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p < 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.	Only the combined intervention yielded effects on quality of life outcomes, and these were limited to anxiety and depression.
__label__Support	55.6% patients treated over 4 days and 33.3% of patients treated over 11 days experienced acute grade ≥ 2 toxicity (p=0.085).	Grade 2 or higher acute toxicity was more common in the 4 day group, approaching statistical significance.
__label__Support	Dignity therapy was significantly better than client-centred care in improving spiritual wellbeing (χ(2)=10·35; p=0·006), and was significantly better than standard palliative care in terms of lessening sadness or depression (χ(2)=9·38; p=0·009);	its benefits in terms of self-reported end-of-life experiences support its clinical application for patients nearing death.
__label__Support	Patients in the IG had significantly improved scores on the FACIT-Fatigue Scale at study completion, improved fatigue and pain scores, as well as overall physical functioning and mental health composite scores.	This is the first prospective, randomized controlled trial to report that participation in a home walking program confers a significant benefit in resected PPC patients with regard to fatigue levels, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life.
__label__Support	QOL was not significantly different between the two arms, except for pain, which showed more clinically meaningful improvement and less deterioration at 6 weeks follow-up (v pretreatment) in the AM arm (P = .003).	However, patient self-assessments suggested a possible advantage to AM that is being explored with modified dosing route strategies.

__label__Support	a positive Hgb response was noted with epoetin alfa treatment.	An unplanned safety analysis suggested decreased overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with epoetin alfa.
__label__Support	Time to 5% deterioration of global health status (primary end point) significantly favored DCF over CF (log-rank test, P = .01).	In V325, advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer patients receiving DCF not only had statistically improved overall survival and time to tumor-progression, but they also had better preservation of QOL compared with patients receiving CF.

__label__Attack	Although our patient sample was small and patients who did not complete the follow-up survey were present,	we could not identify any clinical difference between INT and RY after total gastrectomy 60 months after surgery.
__label__Attack	After a year of follow-up, the effect of CBT for fatigue was no longer observed, and the effect on fatigue seemed to be diminished 7 months postintervention.	The implication is that CBT for fatigue should be offered to patients with cancer with the highest chance to benefit.
__label__Attack	however, this difference may be attributable to the coincidental early death of three patients in the SN group.	Median survival was significantly shorter in the SN group (5.6 months compared with 9 months, unadjusted hazard ratio = 1.6);
__label__Attack	This difference, however, was not observed when the global quality of life was evaluated with the EORTC patients compiled questionnaires.	With the Spitzer's questionnaires a trend towards an improved quality of life index was observed during treatment with the carboplatin combination in comparison to the cisplatin combination.
