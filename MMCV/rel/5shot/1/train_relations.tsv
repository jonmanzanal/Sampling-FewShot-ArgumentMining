__label__noRel	Gastrointestinal toxicity of pamidronate caused a 23% drop-out rate,	Further research on dose and mode of treatment is mandatory.
__label__noRel	We found no difference in follow-up costs.	Medical effects were better after GJJ
__label__Support	Patients in the standard treatment group showed a greater decline in Trial Outcome Index (TOI) scores (physical well-being, functional well-being and breast cancer concerns subscales in FACT-B+4) and recovered more slowly than patients in the SNB group (p < 0.01).	There were significant differences between treatment groups favouring the SNB group throughout the 18 months assessment.
__label__noRel	The unadjusted relative risk for mortality in the octreotide group compared with patients in the control group was 1.11 (95% CI 0.76-1.63; P = 0.59).	When adjusted for Okuda, CTP, and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) scores, the relative risk for octreotide did not change markedly and was 1.05 (95% CI 0.71-1.55; P = 0.83).
__label__Support	Patients with an objective tumor response reported better physical well-being (P < 0.01), mood (P < 0.05), functional performance (P < 0.05) and less effort to cope (P < 0.05) compared with the non-responders and stable disease patients.	tumor response was shown to have a beneficial effect on QoL indicators.
__label__Support	No differences in pain and symptom intensity were observed.	All the three opioids used as first-line therapy were effective, well tolerated, and required similar amounts of symptomatic drugs or co-analgesics.
__label__Attack	However, a trend for more favorable overall survival was documented in the PLD arm compared with the GEM arm,	No statistically significant difference in time to progression (TTP) curves according to treatment allocation was documented (P = .411).
__label__Support	The unadjusted significance level for group differences was P = .0006 for survival to 10 years.	Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated better survival for the experimental group than the control group.
__label__Support	The difference in mean volume change between randomisation groups at 12 months was not statistically significant (P = 0.6), -1.3% (95% CI -6.1 to 3.5), nor was there a significant difference in response at 6 months (P = 0.7), where mean change in arm volume from baseline in the treatment and placebo groups was -2.3% (95% CI -7.9 to 3.4) and -1.1% (95% CI -3.9 to 1.7), respectively.	The study fails to demonstrate efficacy of dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate plus pentoxifylline in patients with arm lymphoedema following axillary surgery and lymphatic radiotherapy, nor does it suggest any benefits of these drugs in radiation-induced induration (fibrosis) in the breast, chest wall, pectoral fold, axilla or supraclavicular fossa.
__label__Attack	There was a high rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia (97%) but not neutropenic fever (12%) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	Neoadjuvant docetaxel-cisplatin followed by CRT was well tolerated with a manageable toxicity profile that allowed subsequent delivery of full-dose CRT.
__label__Attack	no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group.	The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older.
__label__Attack	However, the trend in RR, PFS, and OS favors PC.	VC, GC, and TC are not superior to PC in terms of overall survival (OS).
__label__Attack	yet patients in the experimental group showed a significant increase in the use of PRN analgesics and nonpharmacological strategies to relieve pain (P < .05) and significantly reduce barriers to managing their cancer pain (P < .05) compared with the control group.	Upon the completion of PMP, pain scores were significantly reduced in both groups,
