__label__noRel	Mitomycin-C had no impact on survival (p = 0.75).	The incidence of Grade 4 toxicity was 56% in patients receiving mitomycin-C and 29% in those who did not.
__label__noRel	Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p < 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.	Anxiety scores yielded a quadratic interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.049), with trends for changes in SMEX but not UCO.
__label__Support	Asymptomatic Corrected QT interval (QTC) prolongation was observed in eight vandetanib patients.	Vandetanib failed to demonstrate efficacy as maintenance therapy for small-cell lung cancer.
__label__noRel	but this did not appear to be an important issue to the patients.	the eventual cost-effectiveness will only become clear after long-term follow-up.
__label__noRel	The data suggest that combination therapy might provide another treatment option for SUI in men that might increase the percentage of early postsurgery continence.	There was a significant decrease in pad use in group A.
__label__noRel	Furthermore, letrozole significantly improved distant DFS (HR=0.60; 95% CI 0.43, 0.84; P=0.002) and, in women with node-positive tumors, overall survival (HR=0.61; 95% CI 0.38, 0.98; P=0.04).	Relapse after completing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy is a persistent threat for women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.
__label__Attack	However, the majority of scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 or LC13 showed stabilization of HRQOL with few clinically significant differences between the treatment arms.	This effect is an important clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in the cisplatin/raltitrexed arm.
__label__Support	There was a significant interaction between gender and KPS using FLIC (P = 0.009), which also showed a trend toward significance with FACT (P = 0.09).	Results of this randomized study incorporating prospective QOL measurements suggested that in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, analyzing QOL data by either gender or performance status alone may not accurately reflect how these factors depend upon each another.
__label__Support	The estimated cost of radiotherapy, including retreatments and nonmedical costs, was statistically significantly lower for the single-fraction schedule than for the multiple-fraction schedule ($2438 versus $3311, difference = $873, 95% confidence interval [CI] on the difference = $449 to $1297; P<.001).	Compared with multiple-fraction radiotherapy, single-fraction radiotherapy provides equal palliation and quality of life and has lower medical and societal costs, at least in The Netherlands.
__label__Attack	but TMZ-5 improved overall PFS (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.82; P = .023), survival (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.75; P = .056), and global quality of life (49% v 19% improved > 10 points at 6 months, respectively; P = .005).	For TMZ-5 versus TMZ-21, 12-week PFS rates were similar (63.6% and 65.7%, respectively; P = .745),
__label__Support	The additional charge in the laparoscopic group was $1,748 per patient randomized ($1,194 the result of surgical instruments and $554 the result of longer operative time).	The net balance resulted in $351 extra cost per patient randomly allocated to the laparoscopic group.
__label__Support	A non-significant trend towards delayed time to cough and time to dyspnoea (HR=0.77 [95% CI 0.49-1.21] and HR=0.75 [95% CI 0.48-1.17], respectively) was also observed.	Erlotinib maintenance therapy significantly extends progression-free survival without compromising patient HRQoL in comparison with placebo, with some improvement in symptoms.
__label__Attack	with the exception of poorer sexual function reported by those treated with cryoablation.	In this randomized trial, no long-term QOL advantage for either treatment was apparent
__label__Attack	although longer follow-up is required for a definitive statement on survival.	Docetaxel-carboplatin appears to be similar to paclitaxel-carboplatin in terms of progression-free survival and response,
__label__Attack	Small sample size precludes definitive answers,	but results from this preliminary trial suggest that homeopathy may be of value in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and improving quality of life, especially in those women not on tamoxifen.
