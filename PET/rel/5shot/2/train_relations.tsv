__label__Support	Decreases in IPSS were greater in degarelix than in goserelin-treated patients, differences being statistically significant in patients with baseline IPSS > 13 (-6.7 ± 1.8 vs -4.0 ± 1.0; P = 0.02).	degarelix showed superiority in LUTS relief in symptomatic patients, which could highlight the different actions of these drugs on extrapituitary gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the bladder and/or the prostate.
__label__noRel	Grade 4 neutropenia (27% v 19%) and infusion site pain (10% v 0.5%) were reported more frequently in the ASA404 arm.	no OS difference was seen in the histologic (squamous or nonsquamous) and sex (male or female) strata.
__label__noRel	AT represents a valid option for the treatment of MBC.	Severe nonhematologic toxicity was infrequent in both groups, including grade 3/4 cardiac events (AT, 3%; AC, 4%).
__label__noRel	tumor response was shown to have a beneficial effect on QoL indicators.	Other grade 3/4 toxic effects were rare (<5%).
__label__noRel	The hypothesised improvement in overall quality of life with the omission of radiotherapy was not seen in the EuroQol assessment or in the functionality and symptoms summary domains of the European Organisation for Research in the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scales.	Radiotherapy was then associated with increased breast symptoms and with greater fatigue but with less insomnia and endocrine side-effects.
__label__Support	In limited disease the estimated percentages of survival at 2 years were 33% in the early and 24% in the late alternating chemotherapy arms.	late alternating chemotherapy allows for a higher RDI of cisplatin, adriamycin and etoposide, which results in a significantly longer median survival of patients with extensive disease.
__label__noRel	Results showed a significant increase in pain knowledge in patients who received the Pain Education Program and a significant decrease in pain intensity.	However, pain relief was mainly found in the intervention group patients without district nursing.
__label__Support	Two patients, 1 in each arm, remained in complete remission at the time of last follow-up, at 45+ and 38+ months from treatment.	Compared with IFN5, IFN1 is neither more nor less effective but is less toxic, with a better reported QOL.
__label__Support	CRF was significantly reduced in the intervention group, corresponding to a Fatigue score reduction of 3.04 (effect size of 0.44, 95% CI 0.17-0.72) (P = .002), the FACT-An score by 5.40 (P = .015), the FACT-An Toi score by 5.22 (P = .009) and the Anaemia-ANS by 3.76 (P = .002).	In summary, this six-week supervised multimodal exercise intervention can lead to significant reduction in self-reported CRF in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
__label__Support	In a longitudinal analysis of men in SPCG-4 who provided information at two follow-up points 9 years apart, 38 (45%) of 85 men allocated radical prostatectomy and 48 (60%) of 80 men allocated watchful waiting reported an increase in number of physical symptoms; 50 (61%) of 82 and 47 (64%) of 74 men, respectively, reported a reduction in quality of life.	The number and severity of side-effects changes over time at a higher rate than is caused by normal ageing and a loss of sexual ability is a persistent psychological problem for both interventions.
__label__Attack	Although the ability of dignity therapy to mitigate outright distress, such as depression, desire for death or suicidality, has yet to be proven,	its benefits in terms of self-reported end-of-life experiences support its clinical application for patients nearing death.
__label__Attack	However, there was no QoL difference at the time of ablation between T4-WD and T3-WD Groups.	QoL was better preserved in rhTSH Group than in T4-WD and T3-WD Groups (p < 0.0001).
__label__Attack	We recommend implementation alongside evaluation in wider clinical settings and patient populations.	This intervention significantly reduced the unmet needs of cancer survivors and it is likely that it is cost-effective.
__label__Attack	the education/support intervention was more beneficial to patients/caregivers with Stage I cancer.	results from this study suggest that psychosocial interventions can lead to improvements in a range of outcomes for cancer patients.
__label__Attack	Grade 4 neutropenia (27% v 19%) and infusion site pain (10% v 0.5%) were reported more frequently in the ASA404 arm.	The addition of ASA404 to carboplatin and paclitaxel, although generally well tolerated, failed to improve frontline efficacy in advanced NSCLC.
