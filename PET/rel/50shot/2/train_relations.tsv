Darbepoetin alfa, when administered synchronously with chemotherapy, on an EDS appears to be similarly efficacious to darbepoetin alfa weekly dosing with no unexpected adverse events.
__label__Support	QOL decreased during the first 8 weeks of treatment, and a partial recovery followed.	Treatment, particularly the combination therapy, was associated with a decrease in QOL.
__label__Support	At 1 year, symptom scores were better in the surgical group (P=0.03).	In women with symptomatic fibroids, the faster recovery after embolization must be weighed against the need for further treatment in a minority of patients.

__label__Support	Severe toxicities of TOM + LFA-5-FU were neutropenia (16%) and diarrhoea (16%), but median relative DI8 was 93% for TOM, and 82% for 5-FU.	The TOM + LFA 5-FU regimen showed a RR and a toxicity profile very close to the MTX + LFA 5-FU combination, and does not deserve further evaluation in advanced colorectal cancer patients.
__label__Support	Median OS was 9.45 and 10 months respectively for weekly VNR/CDDP arm and the day 1-8 VNR/CDDP one without statistically a significant difference (log-rank test, p=0.259).	The two schedules are equivalent in terms of overall response rate, median time-to-progression and overall survival.

Vandetanib failed to demonstrate efficacy as maintenance therapy for small-cell lung cancer.
__label__Support	Median survival was 16.6 months for the FU/LV/bevacizumab group and 12.9 months for the FU/LV/placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; P = .16).	Addition of bevacizumab to FU/LV as first-line therapy in CRC patients who were not considered optimal candidates for first-line irinotecan treatment provided clinically significant patient benefit, including statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival.
__label__Support	QoL was better preserved in rhTSH Group than in T4-WD and T3-WD Groups (p < 0.0001).	Our study indicates that use of rhTSH preserves QoL in patients undergoing RI ablation and affords an ablation success rate comparable to that seen after thyroid hormone withdrawal.

__label__Support	There was significantly more grade 3-4 neutropenia (P = .001) and dyspnea (P = .014) with PB+G.	Treatment with PB+G increased the incidence of severe neutropenia and dyspnea,
__label__Support	Three years after radiotherapy, urinary incontinence was reported by 35% of patients, but only 6% required the use of a pad or other protective device.	Comparing the results 2 and 3 years after radiotherapy, the symptoms of rectal bleeding had improved, erectile function had decreased, and urinary urge incontinence had increased.
__label__Support	There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in ES total scores.	In this, the first report of HRQoL over 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, we conclude that anastrozole and tamoxifen had similar impacts on HRQoL, which was maintained or slightly improved during the treatment period for both groups.

"There was no significant difference in average score values between the ""healer"" and the actor with regard to the primary (p = 0.34) or the secondary endpoint (p = 0.94),"
__label__Support	QOL and sexual function are not negatively influenced by these 2 treatment options	Tamoxifen has been shown to be more effective and safe than RT in this setting.
__label__Attack	but not on objective sleep or fatigue outcomes.	The BT group, on average, experienced significant improvement on global sleep quality compared with the HEC group,
__label__Attack	However, this difference did not translate into a worse feeling of general well-being as measured by a simple visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3).	Patients allocated to misoprostol did report slightly increased soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a greater use of analgesics.
__label__Attack	although bowel function differences disappeared over the 5-year period.	The addition of RT to surgery resulted in more frequent urination, as well as early report of more bowel dysfunction
__label__Attack	but this finding was inconsistent across different methods of analysis.	The dyspnoea palliation rate was lower in the C3 arm at 18 and 26 weeks (P<0.05),
__label__Attack	The changes between baseline and months 5 and 7, respectively, indicated improvement in responders but heterogeneous patterns in patients with SD(6m).	patients with CR/PR reported better QL, suggesting more beneficial response to second-line endocrine treatment.
__label__Attack	However, pain relief was mainly found in the intervention group patients without district nursing.	Results showed a significant increase in pain knowledge in patients who received the Pain Education Program and a significant decrease in pain intensity.
__label__Attack	the latter increases were unrelated to improved health.	Although the intervention simultaneously improved patients' T-cell blastogenesis in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA),
__label__Attack	although the P value was of borderline statistical significance (P = .048).	However, a trend for more favorable overall survival was documented in the PLD arm compared with the GEM arm,
__label__Attack	but by 4 months posttreatment, there was no difference.	During treatment, quality of life declined significantly more with the 16-week regimen than CAF,
__label__Attack	although not all differences reached statistical significance.	Several aspects of the quality of life were rated to be better in group B than in group A,
__label__Attack	The patient accrual to this trial made its results inconclusive,	local control and survival were essentially equal between the surgical and RT arms.
__label__Attack	Thus far, with a median follow-up of 86 weeks, median survival has not been reached in either group.	From the 1-year survival analysis, the hazard ratio for probability of death was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.72).
__label__Attack	no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group.	The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older.
__label__Attack	except more patients in the thalidomide group had rash, constipation, or neuropathy.	There were no statistically significant differences between treatments in hematological and nonhematological toxic effects,
__label__Attack	However, the majority of scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 or LC13 showed stabilization of HRQOL with few clinically significant differences between the treatment arms.	This effect is an important clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in the cisplatin/raltitrexed arm.
__label__Attack	However, modifications are needed in future randomized trials to reduce the rate of premature termination and to improve long-term maintenance of gains.	The results of this brief pilot counseling intervention demonstrated significant gains in sexual function and satisfaction and increased utilization of treatments for ED.
__label__Attack	but there was a reduction in pain and no change in global QOL.	fatigue, nausea, and vomiting worsened,
__label__Attack	However, the magnitude of this difference was not helpful in defining which patients were likely to respond.	Pretreatment serum erythropoietin levels were lower in responders than in nonresponders (73.5 IU/L and 86.3 IU/L means, respectively).
__label__Attack	Distress reduction is highlighted as an important mechanism by which health can be improved.	However, it is not clear whether psychological improvements are, in turn, related to improved health.
__label__Attack	although febrile neutropenia and infections were more frequent for patients taking AT (respectively, 33% v 10%, P <.001; 8% v 2%, P =.01).	Grade 3/4 neutropenia was frequent in both groups,
__label__Attack	but TMZ-5 improved overall PFS (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.82; P = .023), survival (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.75; P = .056), and global quality of life (49% v 19% improved > 10 points at 6 months, respectively; P = .005).	For TMZ-5 versus TMZ-21, 12-week PFS rates were similar (63.6% and 65.7%, respectively; P = .745),
__label__Attack	Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppressions were more frequent with GC (anaemia: 14% GC vs 2% PE; leucopenia: 32% GC vs 13% PE; thrombocytopenia: 22% GC vs 4% PE),	GC is as effective as PE in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival and has a toxicity profile more acceptable to patients.
__label__Attack	but this was not associated with increased hospital admission or fatality.	More thrombocytopenia occurred with GCa (P = .03),
__label__Attack	but it was not statistically significant ($4700 versus $6453, difference = $1753, 95% CI on the difference = -$99 to $3604; P =.06).	The estimated difference in total societal costs was larger, also in favor of the single-fraction schedule,
__label__Attack	There was significant early attrition due to disease progression; only 61.5% of patients were alive at 2 months.	There was no significant difference between the two schedules examined in terms of improvement in KP or QOL, but there seemed to be a trend in favor of the 3w4 schedule.
__label__Attack	although longer follow-up is required for a definitive statement on survival.	Docetaxel-carboplatin appears to be similar to paclitaxel-carboplatin in terms of progression-free survival and response,
__label__Attack	but not for function discussion, suggesting that potentially serious problems may remain unaddressed.	A positive longitudinal impact of the intervention on symptom discussion was observed,
__label__Attack	no group effects were found.	Fatigue was lower at 1 year than before CTX;
__label__Attack	but the apparent inferior efficacy may discourage further investigation	This toxicity profile of GE is similar to GP,
__label__Attack	but late complications were more frequent after rigid stenting (risk ratio=2.47; 95% CI 1.88-3.04).	There were no differences in the in-hospital mortality or early complication rates,
__label__Attack	The effect appeared to be dose-dependent.	Pamidronate treatment of breast cancer patients efficaciously reduced skeletal morbidity.
__label__Attack	However, patient self-assessments suggested a possible advantage to AM that is being explored with modified dosing route strategies.	AM did not significantly reduce esophagitis >/= grade 3 in patients receiving hyperfractionated radiation and chemotherapy.
__label__Attack	There was a high rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia (97%) but not neutropenic fever (12%) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	Neoadjuvant docetaxel-cisplatin followed by CRT was well tolerated with a manageable toxicity profile that allowed subsequent delivery of full-dose CRT.
__label__Attack	Self-reported severity of facial hair in the intervention group (n = 51) fell from 7.3 to 3.6 over the 6-month study period; for the control group (n = 37) the corresponding scores were 7.1 and 6.1.	Laser treatment appeared to reduce the severity of facial hair and time spent on hair removal as well as alleviating depression and anxiety in women with PCOS.
__label__Attack	but were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing.	Other analyzed QOL parameters favored the group receiving placebo
__label__Attack	The improvement in pain-related impairment was not sustained at 6 and 12 weeks.	At 2 weeks, assignment to TEC was associated with improvement in pain-related impairment (-0.25 points on a 5-point scale, 95% confidence interval -0.43 to -0.06, P=.01)
__label__Attack	These differences were not significant.	The corresponding mean amounts of residual contrast-enhancing tumor tissue were 29.2 and 24.4%, respectively.
__label__Attack	Further research on dose and mode of treatment is mandatory.	Pamidronate treatment of breast cancer patients efficaciously reduced skeletal morbidity.
__label__Attack	with the exception of poorer sexual function reported by those treated with cryoablation.	In this randomized trial, no long-term QOL advantage for either treatment was apparent
__label__Attack	except for tumor hemorrhage-type events with gefitinib (8.9%, gefitinib 250 mg/day; 11.4%, gefitinib 500 mg/day; 1.9%, methotrexate).	No unexpected adverse events were observed,
__label__Attack	Grade 4 neutropenia (27% v 19%) and infusion site pain (10% v 0.5%) were reported more frequently in the ASA404 arm.	The addition of ASA404 to carboplatin and paclitaxel, although generally well tolerated, failed to improve frontline efficacy in advanced NSCLC.
