__label__noRel	There were no grade 3-4 late radiation toxicities.	Corresponding median failure-free survival times were 3.1 and 1.7 months (P = 0.20).
__label__noRel	The ablation rate was equivalent between the (131)I doses and between the thyrotropin-stimulation methods.	In the 684 patients with data that could be evaluated, ultrasonography of the neck was normal in 652 (95%), and the stimulated thyroglobulin level was 1.0 ng per milliliter or less in 621 of the 652 patients (95%) without detectable thyroglobulin antibodies.
__label__noRel	Moist desquamation was correlated with increased pain and reduction in the quality of life.	Dermatitis is a frequent adverse effect of adjuvant breast radiotherapy.
__label__noRel	There is no consensus on an accepted intervention that significantly reduces its severity.	Patients allocated to misoprostol did report slightly increased soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a greater use of analgesics.
__label__noRel	Eighteen patients receiving IFN5 and 4 patients receiving IFN1 had dose reductions (P = .002).	There was a significant deterioration in QOL and an increase in depression associated with IFN5 but no change was noted with IFN1.
__label__noRel	AT significantly improves TTP and ORR compared with AC in patients with MBC,	Overall survival (OS) was comparable in both arms.
__label__noRel	Short-term administration of exogenous ghrelin at the start of cisplatin-based chemotherapy stimulated food intake and minimized adverse events.	Food intake and appetite VAS scores were significantly higher in the ghrelin group than in the placebo group (18.2 ± 5.2 kcal/kg/day vs 12.7 ± 3.4 kcal/kg/day [P = .001] and 6.2 ± 0.9 vs 4.1 ± 0.9 [P < .0001], respectively).
__label__Support	The main nonhematologic adverse effect was fatigue (grade 3/4 in 18% of patients).	Carboplatin/vinorelbine is well tolerated by elderly patients with extensive-stage NSCLC.
__label__noRel	There was no significant difference between groups in all outcome variables (P > 0.05) through the whole study period.	More efficient treatment protocol is needed for clinical practice.
__label__noRel	Among all treatment groups, patients who had a mastectomy had the poorest physical functioning at registration (P<.001) and at enrollment (P=.05).	Sexual functioning was worse for women who received chemotherapy than for those who did not, regardless of type of surgery (P<.001).
__label__noRel	There was no difference between groups in mean change in EXIT25 score from baseline to 6-month follow-up assessment.	These data suggest that epoetin alfa may have attenuated the cognitive impairment and fatigue that occurred during adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy.
__label__noRel	but these were not associated with increased hospital admissions, infections or fatalities.	Median progression-free survival was 5.9 months with GC and 6.3 months with PE.
__label__noRel	Axillary clearance in early breast cancer aims to improve locoregional control and provide staging information	but the differences tended to disappear in 6 to 12 months.
__label__noRel	However, it may be associated with more inconvenience in wound care and longer healing time than rhomboid excision and Lindberg flap.	Time to final healing was significantly shorter and quality of life scores on the CWIS were higher in patients receiving RELP than in those receiving UM.
__label__noRel	In minimally symptomatic patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, no persuasive evidence was found to indicate that giving immediate palliative thoracic radiotherapy improves symptom control, quality of life, or survival when compared with delaying until symptoms require treatment.	The primary outcome measure was achieved in 28% of the immediate treatment group and 26% of patients from the delayed treatment group (27/97 and 27/103, respectively; absolute difference 1.6%, 95% confidence interval -10.7% to 13.9%).
__label__noRel	No difference in the 1-year survival rate (70% vs. 66%) or median survival time (19.4 vs. 17.4 months) between the surgery and RT arms.	No acute Grade 4 radiation toxicity developed.
__label__noRel	This translated into a lower proportion of patients experiencing moist desquamation during or up to 6 weeks after their radiation treatment; 31.2% with IMRT compared with 47.8% with standard treatment (P = .002).	Breast IMRT significantly improved the dose distribution compared with standard radiation.
__label__noRel	except for tumor hemorrhage-type events with gefitinib (8.9%, gefitinib 250 mg/day; 11.4%, gefitinib 500 mg/day; 1.9%, methotrexate).	Neither gefitinib 250 nor 500 mg/day improved overall survival compared with methotrexate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.57; P = .12; and HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.43; P = .39, respectively).
__label__noRel	We found a consistent pattern of better QOL outcomes at each follow-up assessment during the first 6 months of treatment for orchiectomized patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received placebo versus flutamide.	Cross-sectional analyses (corrected for multiple testing) identified statistically significant differences that favored orchiectomy plus placebo for two of the five primary QOL parameters as follows: patients receiving flutamide reported more diarrhea at 3 months (P = .001) and worse emotional functioning at 3 and 6 months (both P<.003).
__label__noRel	More patients survived >/= 3 years in the D3P and D1P arms (18.6% and 16.6%, respectively) compared with the MP arm (13.5%).	The survival benefit of D3P compared with MP has persisted with extended follow-up (P = .004).
__label__noRel	Complete resection was performed in 73% of 26 patients undergoing thoracotomy.	No acute Grade 4 radiation toxicity developed.
__label__noRel	This difference was not statistically significant (log-rank test, p=0.818).	Median OS was 9.45 and 10 months respectively for weekly VNR/CDDP arm and the day 1-8 VNR/CDDP one without statistically a significant difference (log-rank test, p=0.259).
__label__noRel	Tamoxifen has been shown to be more effective and safe than RT in this setting.	Treatments were well tolerated in the 3 groups.

__label__Support	Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p < 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.	Only the combined intervention yielded effects on quality of life outcomes, and these were limited to anxiety and depression.
__label__noRel	Median survival was 16.6 months for the FU/LV/bevacizumab group and 12.9 months for the FU/LV/placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; P = .16).	Median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (FU/LV/bevacizumab) and 5.5 months (FU/LV/placebo);
__label__noRel	Additional studies should be done in this area to determine the optimum training program.	Three of the quality-of-life domains showed trends toward increases in the exercise group: physical functioning (P =.050), general health (P =.048), and vitality (P =.023).
__label__noRel	Progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients in the Tomudex arm was statistically lower compared to that of patients treated with LV5FU2 or ldLV5FU2 (combined group; p = 0.013, log rank test).	At least one episode of grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 27, 25, 38 and 47% of the patients in the LV5FU2, ldLV5FU2, HD-FU and Tomudex arms, respectively (p = 0.016).
__label__noRel	Frequencies of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were essentially similar.	Equivalence for three versus four cycles is claimed because both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% CL are less than 5%.
__label__noRel	Age-adjusted risk profiles that consider patient-reported outcomes enable patients to adapt to their disease and treatment, such as considering the trade-offs between delayed endocrine symptoms, but higher risk of permanent menopause with chemotherapy, and immediate but reversible endocrine symptoms with goserelin, in younger premenopausal patients.	Younger patients (< 40 years) who received goserelin alone returned to their premenopausal status at 6 months after the cessation of therapy, while those who received CMF showed marginal changes from their baseline hot flashes scores.
__label__noRel	From the 1-year survival analysis, the hazard ratio for probability of death was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.72).	with bicalutamide, hot flushes occurred less often and breast tenderness and gynecomastia more often.
__label__noRel	It is more likely in full-breasted women and when the radiation is distributed nonhomogeneously in the breast.	Breast IMRT significantly reduced the occurrence of moist desquamation compared with a standard wedged technique.
__label__noRel	The median time to progression for marimastat patients was 4.3 months compared with 4.4 months for placebo patients (P =.81).	Toxicity was generally limited to musculoskeletal symptoms (18% grade 3/4 for marimastat).
__label__noRel	Severe HSRs were rare (1.5% patients) and were not affected by either dose or schedule.	but this was not statistically significant (P = .2).
__label__noRel	No significant differences were noted in the distress levels before and after completion of the study in the three groups.	significantly more patients who had received dignity therapy reported that the study group had been satisfactory, compared with those who received standard palliative care (χ(2)=29·58; p<0·0001).
__label__noRel	at 6 months follow-up, participants attending five or more sessions trended toward retaining treatment effects better in the MBAT than in the control group.	Results showed overall significant improvements in psychosocial stress and quality of life in both the MBAT and educational support groups immediately post-intervention;
__label__Support	No survival differences were noted.	The 3-hour infusion of Taxol is safe when given with premedication and is associated with less neutropenia.
__label__noRel	although this is not statistically significant.	The role of three-drug combinations remains questionable in this subset of patients.
__label__noRel	Patients with low PSA nadir do significantly worse with IAD compared with CAD.	No QOL difference was found, although more side effects occurred in CAD.
__label__noRel	Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity did not exceed 15% in both treatment arms.	The rate of stable disease was, however, greater in the combination arm (60.2% v 40.2%; P < .001)
__label__noRel	Nadir prostate-specific antigen values occurred at a median of 18.0 (3.0-54.0) months after RT.	The 5-year biochemical +/- clinical relapse-free and overall survival was 55.9% and 85.3% respectively for all patients, and did not differ between the two schedules.
__label__Support	AET improved global sleep quality in patients with lymphoma who had indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P = 0.001), were receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.013), were <2 years post-diagnosis (P = 0.005), were obese (P = 0.025), and were poor sleepers at baseline (P = 0.007).	however, clinically identifiable subgroups appeared to benefit.
__label__noRel	For 19 'per protocol' patients, 2/10 in the RS + WBRT arm had distant intracranial failure (one also had local failure) and 3/9 S + WBRT patients had distant intracranial failure (no local failures).	There were no grade 3-4 late radiation toxicities.
__label__Support	Median survival was 14.6 months (temozolomide + radiotherapy) versus 12.1 months (radiotherapy alone).	Patients receiving concomitant and maintenance temozolomide + radiotherapy had significantly improved overall survival.
__label__noRel	Mitomycin-C had no impact on survival (p = 0.75).	The 3- and 5-year survival rates of nonsurgical therapy were comparable to published surgical trials of N2 disease.
__label__noRel	In the 5- versus 3-day comparison, the projected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively (difference, -0.9%, (80% CL, -4.1%, +2.2%).	Equivalence for three versus four cycles is claimed because both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% CL are less than 5%.
__label__noRel	In response to training, QOL, VO2peak (mean 3.9 ml/kg/min; 95 % CI, 0.93, 6.90) performance in leg press (17.9 kg; 95 % CI, 12.8, 22.4) and sit-stand test (- 0.67 s; 95 % CI, - 0.52, - 1.2) improved (p < or = 0.05).	We observed no significant changes in the control group.
__label__noRel	There was no significant difference in the mean area under the mucositis curve (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1).	There is a paucity of high-level evidence on potentially useful interventions and a continued need for new and innovative research, incorporating quality-of-life measurements, in patients experiencing radiation-induced mucositis.
__label__noRel	The hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) were 1.36 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.90) for VC, 1.39 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.96) for GC, and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.78) for TC.	Response rates (RRs) for PC, VC, GC, and TC were 29.1%, 25.9%, 22.3%, and 23.4%, respectively.
__label__noRel	Methadone was significantly less expensive, but required more changes, up and down, of the doses, suggesting that dose titration of this drug requires major clinical expertise.	No differences in pain and symptom intensity were observed.
__label__noRel	These findings provide evidence for the short-term benefits of minimally invasive oesophagectomy for patients with resectable oesophageal cancer.	16 (29%) patients in the open oesophagectomy group had pulmonary infection in the first 2 weeks compared with five (9%) in the minimally invasive group (relative risk [RR] 0·30, 95% CI 0·12-0·76; p=0·005).

__label__noRel	A significant immediate and insignificant long-term effect on limb volume was noted.	ALT was found to be a safe method, with high adherence, in treating women who suffer from mild to moderate lymphedema.
__label__noRel	Our study indicates that use of rhTSH preserves QoL in patients undergoing RI ablation and affords an ablation success rate comparable to that seen after thyroid hormone withdrawal.	QoL was better preserved in rhTSH Group than in T4-WD and T3-WD Groups (p < 0.0001).
__label__Support	There was a significant decrease in QoL from baseline (t0) to t1 (RRA period) in the hypothyroid group with significant differences in FACIT-F TOI (P < 10(-3)), FACT-G total score (P = 0.005) and FACIT-F total score (P = 0.003).	rhTSH preserves QoL of patients undergoing RRA with similar rates of ablation success compared to hypothyrodism.
__label__Attack	However, exercise is not better than progressive relaxation training for the treatment of fatigue in this setting.	We conclude that a structured aerobic training programme improves the physical performance of patients recovering from surgery for solid tumours.
__label__Support	Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity did not exceed 15% in both treatment arms.	These results support the efficacy and safety of an every-2-weeks treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin.
__label__Attack	although the difference did not attain statistical significance.	Median overall survival and progression-free survival were more favorable in the combination arm as compared with gemcitabine alone,
__label__Support	Need for reintervention was 19, 10, and 33 % in these groups, respectively (p = 0.123).	Complete fibroid infarction does not translate into total freedom from a subsequent reintervention.
__label__Support	Compared with standard TPN, a higher serum prealbumin level and better nitrogen balance were observed in glutamine-enriched TPN (P = 0.039 and 0.048 respectively).	Our present study shows that glutamine-enriched TPN may be beneficial in improving the inflammatory status and decreasing the infectious morbidity in postoperative GI cancer patients.
__label__Support	More major complications (P = 0.02) occurred and more reinterventions were performed (P < 0.01) after stent placement than after GJJ.	Medical effects were better after GJJ
__label__Attack	Self-reported severity of facial hair in the intervention group (n = 51) fell from 7.3 to 3.6 over the 6-month study period; for the control group (n = 37) the corresponding scores were 7.1 and 6.1.	Laser treatment appeared to reduce the severity of facial hair and time spent on hair removal as well as alleviating depression and anxiety in women with PCOS.
__label__Support	This study demonstrated no advantage in RR, RD, or PFS but significantly superior OS for DPPE plus DOX.	Additional studies of DPPE are warranted.

__label__Support	At 3 months, G1 patients maintained/improved function, symptoms, and single-item scores (P < .02); in G2, only few function and symptom scales improved (P < .05); in G3, QoL remained as poor as after radiotherapy.	dietary counseling was of similar or higher benefit, whereas even 3 months after RT, it was the only method to sustain a significant impact on patient outcomes.
__label__Support	The QLQ-C30 subscales pain (P=0.12), insomnia (P=0.068), appetite loss (P=0.074) and the QLQ-MY24 item sick (P=0.086) scored marginally better during thalidomide maintenance.	This study shows that the higher frequency of toxicity associated with MPT does not translate into a negative effect on HRQoL and that MPT holds a better patient perspective.
__label__Support	Strong opioids were safe and well-tolerated, with no development of tolerance or serious adverse events.	These data suggest the utility of strong opioids for first-line treatment of pain in patients with terminal cancer.
__label__Support	There were no statistically significant differences between treatments in hematological and nonhematological toxic effects,	QoL scores were similar in the two treatment groups,
__label__Support	For the chemotherapy group, the mean Quality Adjusted Life Months over 24 months (QALM-24) was 9.6 (95% CI: 8.7, 11.2) months compared with the mean QALM-24 of 8.6 (95% CI: 7.6, 10.5) months for the no chemotherapy group.	Chemotherapy provided on average an additional 1.0 quality-adjusted life months within a restricted 2-year time period from the time of resection.
__label__Support	Sensitivity analyses showed that varying the mean hospital cost per day from the 5th to the 95th percentile resulted in cost-utility ratios ranging from 20,326 dollars to as low as 6360 dollars.	Capecitabine/docetaxel was a cost-effective treatment in patients with anthracycline-pretreated advanced breast carcinoma, and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that compares very favorably with that of many other oncology therapies.
__label__Support	Analysing response to FUFA and FOLFIRI in the per protocol set (n=119) after un-blinding TS in the data base revealed a trend to better overall response to FOLFIRI (9/19, 47%) in TS high compared to FUFA (5/23, 22%, p=0.077).	After validation of our data in a larger group TS determination may have the potential to better help direct systemic treatment in patients with primarily non-resectable mCRC.
__label__Support	Replacement of most hospital follow-up visits in the first year after breast cancer treatment by nurse-led telephone follow-up does not impede patient outcomes.	nurse-led telephone follow-up seems an appropriate way to reduce clinic visits and represents an accepted alternative strategy.
__label__Support	Two-year survival rate was 18% with DCF and 9% with CF.	Adding docetaxel to CF significantly improved TTP, survival, and response rate in gastric cancer patients, but resulted in some increase in toxicity.
__label__Support	These results show an improvement over previous SIOP study (RMS75) in which survival was 52% and event-free survival was 47%.	Compared with the results obtained in the previous SIOP study, treatment in MMT84 was based on response to initial chemotherapy and, despite an overall reduction of the use of local therapy, significantly improved survival for patients with non-metastatic disease.
__label__Support	The RRs were identical in the 2 arms (6.7%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.8-16.5%).	Compared with IFN5, IFN1 is neither more nor less effective but is less toxic, with a better reported QOL.
__label__Support	When participants in the sham acupuncture group were crossed over to true acupuncture, a further reduction in the frequency of hot flashes was seen.	Hot flash frequency in breast cancer patients was reduced following acupuncture.
__label__Support	Median and 1-year survival rates were 10.0 months and 38.4% for NP, and 8.2 months and 33.7% for NIP, respectively.	This confirms that the two-drug combination NP is a reference treatment for metastatic NSCLC.
__label__Support	At eight weeks, patients in the thalidomide group had lost 0.06 kg in weight and 0.5 cm(3) in AMA compared with a loss of 3.62 kg (absolute difference -3.57 kg (95% CI -6.8 to -0.3); p = 0.034) and 8.4 cm(3) (absolute difference -7.9 cm(3) (95% CI -14.0 to -1.8); p = 0.014) in the placebo group.	Thalidomide was well tolerated and effective at attenuating loss of weight and lean body mass in patients with cachexia due to advanced pancreatic cancer.
__label__Attack	However, this difference did not translate into a worse feeling of general well-being as measured by a simple visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3).	Patients allocated to misoprostol did report slightly increased soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a greater use of analgesics.
__label__Support	Patients allocated to oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 9.0 v 6.2 months; P =.0003) and better response rate (50.7% v 22.3%; P =.0001) when compared with the control arm.	The LV5FU2-oxaliplatin combination seems beneficial as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer, demonstrating a prolonged progression-free survival with acceptable tolerability and maintenance of QoL.
__label__Support	however, stomatitis (11% in FU + LV v 3% in FU24h v 5% in FU24h + LV arms) and hematologic toxicity were higher in the bolus FU + LV arm.	Global quality of life did not differ within the three arms.
__label__Support	Manual lymphatic drainage showed no significant changes in any of the outcomes.	Although there are no significant differences between treatment changes,
__label__Support	HRQOL and AEs were similar with exemestane and anastrozole.	Given the results of the TEAM trial, upfront use of tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor (AI) may be an important option for adjuvant endocrine therapy in Japanese postmenopausal women.
__label__Support	Parenteral feeding was associated with the highest rate of nutrition-related complications,	After major surgery, specialized supportive enteral and parenteral nutrition are not superior to oral nutrition only when guided by a dietitian.
__label__Support	Mean scores were generally improved by the end-of-treatment assessment vs. baseline in both arms.	These findings demonstrate clinically meaningful, transitory HRQoL decrements with VMP and relatively lower HRQoL vs. MP during early treatment cycles, associated with the expected additional toxicities.
__label__Attack	The effect of grape juice flavonoids on CINV should be investigated further with a larger sample to determine whether preliminary findings are supported.	Flavonoid-rich fruits and vegetables may provide additional protection against CINV.
__label__Support	There was a significant improvement in physical functioning (coefficient, 10.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-17.5; P = .009), and this effect remained once the confounding effects of mood disturbance and comorbid disorders were controlled statistically.	The behaviorally oriented intervention brought about significant improvements in physical functioning, indicated a trend toward improved CRF, but detected no effect for fatigue-related distress.
__label__Support	QOL was poorer for patients receiving AC→T at 6 months but similar to others by 12 months.	Patients treated with longer duration therapy (AC→T) had greater symptom severity and poorer QOL at 6 months, but did not differ from shorter duration treatments at 12 months.
__label__Support	No significant difference was observed in quality of life and adverse events between the treated groups and the placebo group.	CRO is effective, safe, and cost-effective in the control of postoperative pain after transarterial chemoembolization for patients with inoperable liver cancer.
__label__Support	Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).	Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.
__label__Support	The linear analogue self-assessment scale was less but significantly efficient for detection of treatment effects, with relative efficiency estimates ranging from 0.16 to 2.45 and a median of 0.66 among the comparisons with relatively stable estimates (/t/ > or = 1.0) and more efficient for recurrence than the adjective checklist.	The mood linear analogue self-assessment scale is a valid indicator of emotional well-being in patients with breast cancer in large multicenter, multicultural trials in which comprehensive scales are less feasible.
__label__Support	From the 1-year survival analysis, the hazard ratio for probability of death was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.72).	the favorable quality of life outcomes and the low incidence of nonhormonal adverse events provide reasons to evaluate bicalutamide, as a single therapeutic agent, at higher doses.
__label__Support	Patients with extensive disease survived significantly longer with late alternating chemotherapy than on the early alternation regimen (median survival 336 days versus 301 days, p = 0.01).	late alternating chemotherapy allows for a higher RDI of cisplatin, adriamycin and etoposide, which results in a significantly longer median survival of patients with extensive disease.
__label__Support	The mean cost per QALY gained with combination therapy was 13,558 dollars (standard deviation, 6742 dollars).	Capecitabine/docetaxel was a cost-effective treatment in patients with anthracycline-pretreated advanced breast carcinoma, and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that compares very favorably with that of many other oncology therapies.
__label__Support	SGN-15 was active against Le(y)-positive tumors in early phase clinical trials and was synergistic with docetaxel in preclinical experiments.	SGN-15 plus docetaxel is a well-tolerated and active second and third line treatment for NSCLC patients
__label__Support	Elbow flexor muscle strength declined by -5.5% (95% CI = -9.6% to -1. 4%) per 4 weeks in the control group but remained stable (0.0%; 95% CI= -1.4% to +1.4%) in the ATP group (P =.01).	ATP has beneficial effects on weight, muscle strength, and QOL in patients with advanced NSCLC.
__label__Support	The superiority of combination therapy over monochemotherapy has not been demonstrated convincingly.	there is no standard therapy for patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.
__label__Support	True acupuncture was associated with 0.8 fewer hot flashes per day than sham at 6 weeks	Hot flash frequency in breast cancer patients was reduced following acupuncture.
__label__Support	We observed no significant changes in the control group.	Combined cardiorespiratory and resistance training, even of very brief duration, improves the QOL and the overall physical fitness of women breast cancer survivors.
__label__Support	The most common grade 3 to 4 toxicities were neutropenia (82.9% for docetaxel; 69.2% for vinorelbine; P = .031) and leukopenia (58.0% for docetaxel; 51.7% for vinorelbine).	Docetaxel monotherapy may be considered as an option in the standard treatment of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.
__label__Attack	except for the functional activity score of the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, where QOL data statistically significantly favored the paclitaxel plus supportive care arm (two-sided P =.043).	QOL was similar for both treatment arms,
__label__Support	Gastrointestinal and GU toxicity persisted 5 years after RT and did not differ between the two dose schedules other than in regard to urgency of defecation.	The hypofractionated schedule is equivalent in efficacy to the conventional schedule.
__label__Support	Median duration of response (complete and partial combined) in the group treated with the combination was 33 months (range, 9 to 50 months), versus 22 months (range, 5 to 38 months) for the second group (P =.03).	13-CRA may lengthen response to IFNalpha2a therapy in patients with IFNalpha2a-sensitive tumors.
__label__Attack	but the low compliance does not allow to draw definitive conclusions.	At 6 months after the end of RT, global HRQOL was higher in the TPF arm than in the PF arm,
__label__Support	Additional longitudinal analyses showed a greater increase in loss of appetite in the pemetrexed group than in the placebo group (4·3 mm vs 0·2 mm; p=0·028).	except for a small increase in loss of appetite, and significantly delayed worsening of pain and haemoptysis.
__label__Support	No significant difference in time to progression or survival was found between the two arms.	Patients treated with single-agent E followed by single-agent M had similar survival, but less treatment-related toxicity and better QOL as compared with those treated with CEF followed by MV.
__label__Attack	The total efficacy of non-squamous cell carcinoma in the PP group was significantly higher than that in GP group.	The clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin for the treatment of previously untreated advanced NSCLC was roughly the same,
__label__Support	Patients in the chemotherapy group reported better overall physical functioning and symptom control compared with the supportive care group.	In conclusion, treatment with carboplatin and etoposide can improve both the quality of life and the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC.
__label__Attack	but no long-term effect was noted.	ALT had a positive, statistically and clinically significant immediate effect on limb volume
__label__Attack	but the onset of ovarian function suppression was slightly delayed for patients receiving chemotherapy.	As reflected in the hot flashes scores, patients in all three treatment groups experienced induced amenorrhea,
__label__Attack	After a year of follow-up, the effect of CBT for fatigue was no longer observed, and the effect on fatigue seemed to be diminished 7 months postintervention.	The implication is that CBT for fatigue should be offered to patients with cancer with the highest chance to benefit.
__label__Attack	It should probably not be tested further,	The 16-week regimen should not be used instead of a standard-dose regimen without careful consideration of the 16-week regimen's pros and cons, which include its complicated schedule.
__label__Attack	but the treatment arms did not differ with respect to other general measures of HRQL.	Symptom distress was significantly worse for the RP+RT arm compared with the RP alone arm
__label__Attack	but the difference was not statistically significant (GE 15.5%, GP 27.7%, p = 0.20).	The rate of grade 2 or above nausea was numerically higher in the GP arm,
__label__Attack	but among patients with extensive disease, survival was worse in the thalidomide group (HR for death = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.68).	Among patients with limited-stage disease, there was no evidence of a survival difference (HR for death = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.15),
__label__Attack	but the difference did not reach statistical significance (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.4; P = .3).	True acupuncture was associated with 0.8 fewer hot flashes per day than sham at 6 weeks
__label__Attack	Despite slow initial symptom improvement,	GJJ was associated with better long-term results and is therefore the treatment of choice in patients with a life expectancy of 2 months or longer.
__label__Attack	but not quality of life.	The intervention reduced fatigue and improved vitality, aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and physical and functional activity, and emotional wellbeing,
__label__Attack	but not overall survival (OS).	The CP arm produced a significantly higher response rate and progression-free survival (PFS)
__label__Attack	However, the magnitude of this difference was not helpful in defining which patients were likely to respond.	Pretreatment serum erythropoietin levels were lower in responders than in nonresponders (73.5 IU/L and 86.3 IU/L means, respectively).
__label__Attack	however, a trend for a positive response for the estramustine group was found in patients with grade III glioma.	In conclusion, this first randomized study did not demonstrate any significant improvement of using estramustine in addition to conventional radiotherapy,
__label__Attack	there was a trend in the anticipated direction (P=0.083).	The nutrition intervention group had a higher mean protein intake (1.1 to 1.3 g/kg/day) compared with the standard practice group (1.0 to 1.1 g/kg/day) (P=0.001).
__label__Attack	The effect appeared to be dose-dependent.	Pamidronate treatment of breast cancer patients efficaciously reduced skeletal morbidity.
__label__Attack	There is a need for further studies so that its effect can be confirmed.	Pilates exercises are effective and safe in female breast cancer patients.
__label__Attack	Future work is needed to improve the design and the planning of these interventions to improve program adherence.	CBT and PE can have salutary effects on endocrine symptoms and, to a lesser degree, on sexuality and physical functioning of patients with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause.
__label__Attack	but substantive differences in many symptom scores favored docetaxel.	Global quality of life was similar in both arms,
__label__Attack	The change was significantly greater in the intervention group [ancova F((1,83)) = 24.5, P < 0.05].	Self-reported severity of facial hair in the intervention group (n = 51) fell from 7.3 to 3.6 over the 6-month study period; for the control group (n = 37) the corresponding scores were 7.1 and 6.1.
__label__Attack	Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppressions were more frequent with GC (anaemia: 14% GC vs 2% PE; leucopenia: 32% GC vs 13% PE; thrombocytopenia: 22% GC vs 4% PE),	GC is as effective as PE in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival and has a toxicity profile more acceptable to patients.
__label__Attack	except for a small increase in loss of appetite, and significantly delayed worsening of pain and haemoptysis.	Quality of life during maintenance therapy with pemetrexed is similar to placebo,
__label__Attack	but maintained the suppression of resorption at similar levels for a further four weeks.	A second infusion of pamidronate did not decrease resorption further,
__label__Attack	but regression toward baseline was noted at 6-month follow-up.	Participants completing the intervention demonstrated improvement in male overall distress (P < 0.01), male global sexual function (P < 0.0001), and female global sexual function (P < 0.05) at 3-month follow-up,
__label__Attack	However, further research is needed to identify ways to improve the potency and sustainability of psychoeducational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue.	Preparatory education and support has the potential to assist women to cope with cancer-related fatigue in the short term.
__label__Attack	Intrusions were not associated with the trajectory of fatigue, sleep, breast cancer-specific symptoms, or mental functioning;	Intrusive thoughts are associated with enduring elevations in behavioral symptoms and impaired quality of life in the year after breast cancer treatment and may be a risk factor for poor outcomes.
__label__Attack	but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.	HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores
__label__Attack	The addition of RT to surgery resulted in more frequent urination, as well as early report of more bowel dysfunction	The addition of RT did not negatively impact ED.
__label__Attack	but TMZ-5 improved overall PFS (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.82; P = .023), survival (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.75; P = .056), and global quality of life (49% v 19% improved > 10 points at 6 months, respectively; P = .005).	For TMZ-5 versus TMZ-21, 12-week PFS rates were similar (63.6% and 65.7%, respectively; P = .745),
__label__Attack	although the exercise and control group means were significantly different (P <.001).	Arm volume measured by water displacement was correlated with calculated arm volume (r =.973, P <.001),
__label__Attack	but they reported no other effects.	At 4-month follow-up, intervention patients reported less uncertainty and better communication with spouses than control patients,
__label__Attack	However, its safety should be confirmed by the results of larger randomized trials and meta-analyses.	SLN biopsy is an effective and well-tolerated procedure.
__label__Attack	the latter increases were unrelated to improved health.	Although the intervention simultaneously improved patients' T-cell blastogenesis in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA),
__label__Attack	but no other differences were noted.	Among the clinical outcome measures, QOL score improvement was greater for UAE with TAGMs compared with PVA (49.0 vs 27.9; P = .02),
__label__Attack	However, it provided no improvement in PFS or OS compared with flat dosing.	Intrapatient dose escalation of carboplatin based on nadir blood counts is feasible and safe.
__label__Attack	but was unaffected by the use of supplemental radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy.	The dysuria resolved faster in patients implanted with 103Pd
__label__Attack	Distress reduction is highlighted as an important mechanism by which health can be improved.	However, it is not clear whether psychological improvements are, in turn, related to improved health.
__label__Attack	but there was a reduction in pain and no change in global QOL.	fatigue, nausea, and vomiting worsened,
__label__Attack	these two treatment protocols are inefficient and cost time in application.	The study results suggest that K-tape could replace the bandage in DLT, and it could be an alternative choice for the breast-cancer-related lymphedema patient with poor short-stretch bandage compliance after 1-month intervention.
__label__Attack	QoL was similar for both groups at 1 year.	capecitabine was associated with better QoL during treatment
__label__Attack	However, the magnitude of the benefits was small.	Eighteen months after surgery, any differences in quality of life between patients randomized to LAC or open colectomy favored LAC.
__label__Attack	The total efficiencies of non-squamous cell carcinoma were 27.62% and 16.00%.	The clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin for the treatment of previously untreated advanced NSCLC was roughly the same,
