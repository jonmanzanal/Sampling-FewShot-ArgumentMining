__label__Attack	However, this difference did not translate into a worse feeling of general well-being as measured by a simple visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3).	Patients allocated to misoprostol did report slightly increased soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a greater use of analgesics.
__label__Attack	However, identification of prognostic factors from responses to questionnaires may be unstable, and their reliability and clinical utility should be tested prospectively.	patient-assessed QL variables appear to be prognostic for survival and response to chemotherapy in women with advanced breast cancer.
__label__Attack	but this was not statistically significant (P = .2).	Response was slightly higher at the 175-mg/m2 dose (20%) than at 135 mg/m2 (15%),
__label__Attack	but the difference did not reach statistical significance (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.4; P = .3).	True acupuncture was associated with 0.8 fewer hot flashes per day than sham at 6 weeks
__label__Attack	However, the majority of scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 or LC13 showed stabilization of HRQOL with few clinically significant differences between the treatment arms.	This effect is an important clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in the cisplatin/raltitrexed arm.
__label__Attack	but was unaffected by the use of supplemental radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy.	The dysuria resolved faster in patients implanted with 103Pd
__label__Attack	but not overall survival (OS).	The CP arm produced a significantly higher response rate and progression-free survival (PFS)
__label__Attack	but model instability was indicated by the inclusion of fatigue and emotional function in the final model when backward selection was used.	The final multivariate model for response selected DFI (P=0.009), multiple sites of visceral disease (P=0.037) and dyspnoea (P=<0.001) using forward selection,
__label__Attack	However, there was no QoL difference at the time of ablation between T4-WD and T3-WD Groups.	QoL was better preserved in rhTSH Group than in T4-WD and T3-WD Groups (p < 0.0001).
__label__Attack	but it remained unclear whether this combination is more effective than IFNalpha alone in patients with metastatic melanoma.	The combination of interferon alfa (IFNalpha) and isotretinoin has shown a direct antiproliferative effect on human melanoma cell lines,
__label__Attack	but TMZ-5 improved overall PFS (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.82; P = .023), survival (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.75; P = .056), and global quality of life (49% v 19% improved > 10 points at 6 months, respectively; P = .005).	For TMZ-5 versus TMZ-21, 12-week PFS rates were similar (63.6% and 65.7%, respectively; P = .745),
__label__Attack	The Grade 2 or greater urinary toxicity was 10% at 70 Gy and 17.5% at 80 Gy (p = .046).	High-dose radiotherapy provided a better 5-year biochemical outcome with slightly greater toxicity.
__label__Attack	except that more patients with ADPKD were assigned to the placebo group (P = .03).	Baseline characteristics were comparable for both groups,
__label__Attack	However, exercise is not better than progressive relaxation training for the treatment of fatigue in this setting.	We conclude that a structured aerobic training programme improves the physical performance of patients recovering from surgery for solid tumours.
__label__Attack	but this did not appear to be an important issue to the patients.	Cosmetic results were better in those not receiving radiotherapy
__label__Attack	The effect appeared to be dose-dependent.	Pamidronate treatment of breast cancer patients efficaciously reduced skeletal morbidity.
__label__Attack	but few sustained effects.	Both brief and extensive programs had positive outcomes for patient-caregiver dyads,
__label__Attack	The total efficacy of non-squamous cell carcinoma in the PP group was significantly higher than that in GP group.	The clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin for the treatment of previously untreated advanced NSCLC was roughly the same,
__label__Attack	However, patient self-assessments suggested a possible advantage to AM that is being explored with modified dosing route strategies.	AM did not significantly reduce esophagitis >/= grade 3 in patients receiving hyperfractionated radiation and chemotherapy.
__label__Attack	but these were not associated with increased hospital admissions, infections or fatalities.	Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppressions were more frequent with GC (anaemia: 14% GC vs 2% PE; leucopenia: 32% GC vs 13% PE; thrombocytopenia: 22% GC vs 4% PE),
__label__Attack	but maintained the suppression of resorption at similar levels for a further four weeks.	A second infusion of pamidronate did not decrease resorption further,
__label__Attack	Thus far, with a median follow-up of 86 weeks, median survival has not been reached in either group.	From the 1-year survival analysis, the hazard ratio for probability of death was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.72).
__label__Attack	although interpretation of these results is challenging due to baseline imbalance between treatment groups.	More patients treated on 4 consecutive days reported a clinically meaningful increase in dyspnea,
__label__Attack	but were not significantly different at T(12-24) (P = .68) and T(24-48) (P = .10).	When group 1 with group 2 were compared, numeric rating scale scores were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 during the period of T(0-12) (P < .001)
__label__Attack	This difference, however, was not observed when the global quality of life was evaluated with the EORTC patients compiled questionnaires.	With the Spitzer's questionnaires a trend towards an improved quality of life index was observed during treatment with the carboplatin combination in comparison to the cisplatin combination.
__label__Attack	Although it is premature to make any determination as to the efficacy of the interventions tested in this feasibility study,	Both the III + ISG and III-only demonstrated pre-post reductions in depressive symptoms and high rates of utilization compared with other web-based treatments for depression.
__label__Attack	The change was significantly greater in the intervention group [ancova F((1,83)) = 24.5, P < 0.05].	Self-reported severity of facial hair in the intervention group (n = 51) fell from 7.3 to 3.6 over the 6-month study period; for the control group (n = 37) the corresponding scores were 7.1 and 6.1.
__label__Attack	Although the ability of dignity therapy to mitigate outright distress, such as depression, desire for death or suicidality, has yet to be proven,	its benefits in terms of self-reported end-of-life experiences support its clinical application for patients nearing death.
__label__Attack	but this was not associated with increased hospital admission or fatality.	More thrombocytopenia occurred with GCa (P = .03),
__label__Attack	however, this difference may be attributable to the coincidental early death of three patients in the SN group.	Median survival was significantly shorter in the SN group (5.6 months compared with 9 months, unadjusted hazard ratio = 1.6);
__label__Attack	There is a need for further studies so that its effect can be confirmed.	Pilates exercises are effective and safe in female breast cancer patients.
__label__Attack	Although toxicity was higher in patients receiving FLOT,	elderly patients in need of intensified chemotherapy may receive FLOT without compromising patient-reported outcome parameters.
__label__Attack	Myelosuppression, renal insufficiency, and fatigue were more common in the GP arm,	Gefitinib failed to demonstrate superior OS compared with GP as first-line therapy for NSLAs.
__label__Attack	However, modifications are needed in future randomized trials to reduce the rate of premature termination and to improve long-term maintenance of gains.	The results of this brief pilot counseling intervention demonstrated significant gains in sexual function and satisfaction and increased utilization of treatments for ED.
__label__Attack	Further research is needed into a number of areas including the long-term aspects of quality of life, clinical outcomes, costs and consequences of omitting radiotherapy.	Extrapolations from these data suggest that radiotherapy may not be a cost-effective treatment unless it results in a recurrence rate that is at least 5% lower in absolute terms than those treated without radiotherapy.
__label__Attack	However, the trend in RR, PFS, and OS favors PC.	VC, GC, and TC are not superior to PC in terms of overall survival (OS).
__label__Attack	Self-reported severity of facial hair in the intervention group (n = 51) fell from 7.3 to 3.6 over the 6-month study period; for the control group (n = 37) the corresponding scores were 7.1 and 6.1.	Laser treatment appeared to reduce the severity of facial hair and time spent on hair removal as well as alleviating depression and anxiety in women with PCOS.
__label__Attack	but the onset of ovarian function suppression was slightly delayed for patients receiving chemotherapy.	As reflected in the hot flashes scores, patients in all three treatment groups experienced induced amenorrhea,
