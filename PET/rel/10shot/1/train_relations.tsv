__label__noRel	The results of this randomized clinical trial indicate that daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside plus GM-CSF is not a cost-effective treatment strategy when compared with daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside alone.	The average costs of the primary treatment were higher in GM-CSF-treated patients than in the control group, i.e. US$40782 and US$34465, respectively (P < 0.01).
__label__noRel	Randomized trials in fluorouracil (FU)-refractory colorectal cancer demonstrate significant survival advantages for patients receiving irinotecan.	Global quality of life was not statistically different between treatment groups.
__label__noRel	Gefitinib did not show better OS compared with GP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.932; 95% CI, 0.716 to 1.213; P = .604; median OS, 22.3 v 22.9 months, respectively).	The 1-year PFS rates were 16.7% with gefitinib and 2.8% with GP (HR, 1.198; 95% CI, 0.944 to 1.520).
__label__noRel	emotional, functional well-being, and QoL aspects specifically related to lung cancer were better improved in the Gefitinib group than in the Pemetrexed group (P<0.05).	For the Pemetrexed group, objective response rate (ORR) was 13.0% (3/23), disease control rate (DCR) was 30.4% (7/23), and median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 3.1 months.
__label__noRel	The pectoral stretching program did not influence the outcomes measured because the symptoms reported by patients were not a consequence of contracture.	Breast symptoms increased for both groups during radiotherapy, without loss of strength or range of movement.
__label__Support	At 20 wk, 4 wk after planned interruption of duloxetine, we observed a U-turn, 23 patients were completely dry in group A versus 38 in group B (p=0.008).	The decrease in IEF and improvements in I-QoL scores were significantly greater in group A for the first 16 wk.
__label__noRel	Epoetin alfa administered at 40,000 U once weekly (qw) to anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy increases hemoglobin levels, improves quality of life (QOL), and reduces transfusions.	Hemoglobin responses defined as mean hemoglobin > or = 12 g/dL or a > or = 2 g/dL increase compared with baseline were significantly higher in the epoetin alfa group versus SOC: 52.0% v 5.1% and 65.7% v 6.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for both comparisons).
__label__noRel	Dignity therapy was significantly better than client-centred care in improving spiritual wellbeing (χ(2)=10·35; p=0·006), and was significantly better than standard palliative care in terms of lessening sadness or depression (χ(2)=9·38; p=0·009);	No significant differences were noted in the distress levels before and after completion of the study in the three groups.
__label__noRel	Extrapolations from these data suggest that radiotherapy may not be a cost-effective treatment unless it results in a recurrence rate that is at least 5% lower in absolute terms than those treated without radiotherapy.	In the follow-up in this study, there were no recurrences, and the quality of life utilities from EuroQol were almost identical.
__label__noRel	the increase of symptoms seems acceptable and has little extra effect on quality of life after 4 years compared with endocrine treatment alone.	37 (11%) of 350 in the combined group and 23 (7%) of 35 in the endocrine-only group had overall bother from all bowel symptoms (p=0.022).
__label__noRel	The CLIP score seems to predict survival better than both Okuda and CTP score.	There was no difference in the cumulative survival.
__label__Support	After the first year of follow-up, 14 women in the embolization group (13%) required hospitalization, 3 of them for major adverse events and 11 for reintervention for treatment failure.	In women with symptomatic fibroids, the faster recovery after embolization must be weighed against the need for further treatment in a minority of patients.
__label__Support	Patients in both treatment conditions showed improvements in pain, depression, QOL, and self-efficacy, and caregivers in both conditions showed improvements in anxiety and self-efficacy from baseline to four-month follow-up.	results from this study suggest that psychosocial interventions can lead to improvements in a range of outcomes for cancer patients.
__label__Support	Among patients with limited-stage disease, there was no evidence of a survival difference (HR for death = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.15),	thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy did not improve survival of patients with SCLC but was associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events.
__label__Support	No group-related negative effects were observed and the global satisfaction levels were very high.	This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention, which can accelerate the reduction of those negative affects which are present at the end of treatment.
__label__Support	The experimental-to-PC hazard ratios of death were 1.15 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.67) for VC, 1.32 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.92) for GC, and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.82) for TC.	VC, GC, and TC are not superior to PC in terms of overall survival (OS).
__label__Support	Median time to disease progression (33.8 and 40.7 weeks, respectively) and overall survival (41.4 and 57.3 weeks, respectively) were of borderline significance in favor of the GP arm (p = 0.055).	but the apparent inferior efficacy may discourage further investigation
__label__Support	intervention patients had significantly better scores at months 3 and 6 (median 3-month intervention score, 7 [range, 5-7], vs median control score, 5 [range, 3-7] [P = .03]; median 6-month intervention score, 7 [range, 6-7], vs median control score, 6 [range, 3-7] [P = .009]).	Patients who performed prophylactic swallowing exercises had improved swallowing function at 3 and 6 months after CRT but not immediately after CRT or at 9 and 12 months after CRT.
__label__Support	No statistically significant difference in time to progression (TTP) curves according to treatment allocation was documented (P = .411).	GEM does not provide an advantage compared with PLD in terms of TTP in ovarian cancer patients who experience recurrence within 12 months after primary treatment but should be considered in the spectrum of drugs to be possibly used in the salvage setting.
__label__Support	when compared with sham acupuncture, the reduction by the acupuncture regimen as provided in the current study did not reach statistical significance.	We cannot exclude the possibility that a longer and more intense acupuncture intervention could produce a larger reduction of these symptoms.
__label__Attack	Measurable improvement in a general QOL measure was not demonstrated.	A clinical assessment and intervention program for menopausal symptom management in breast cancer survivors is feasible and acceptable to patients, leading to reduction in symptoms and improvement in sexual functioning.
__label__Attack	No significant main effect of the interventions emerged on cancer-specific distress,	A peer-modeling videotape can accelerate the recovery of energy during the re-entry phase in women treated for breast cancer, particularly among those who feel less prepared for re-entry.
__label__Attack	but was controlled with oral medication and did not cause study drug discontinuation.	Grade 3 hypertension was more common with bevacizumab treatment (16% v 3%)
__label__Attack	but this was not statistically significant (P = .2).	Response was slightly higher at the 175-mg/m2 dose (20%) than at 135 mg/m2 (15%),
__label__Attack	The patient accrual to this trial made its results inconclusive,	local control and survival were essentially equal between the surgical and RT arms.
__label__Attack	Distress reduction is highlighted as an important mechanism by which health can be improved.	However, it is not clear whether psychological improvements are, in turn, related to improved health.
__label__Attack	Although the ability of dignity therapy to mitigate outright distress, such as depression, desire for death or suicidality, has yet to be proven,	its benefits in terms of self-reported end-of-life experiences support its clinical application for patients nearing death.
__label__Attack	but not on objective sleep or fatigue outcomes.	The BT group, on average, experienced significant improvement on global sleep quality compared with the HEC group,
__label__Attack	although with different AEs.	The effects of Pemetrexed and Gefitinib as second line therapy were similar,
__label__Attack	but its antimetabolite schedules and frequent drug administration (ie, dose density) should be considered in the development of new regimens.	It should probably not be tested further,
