__label__noRel	A more effective, better tolerated version of this FUP combination is needed.	Toxicity (WHO grade 3-4) was lower with FU than with FUP (20% versus 48%, P <0.001), as was neutropenia (6% versus 23%), vomiting (4% versus 17%) and toxicity-related deaths (one versus four early in the trial).
__label__noRel	The results of this study have demonstrated the importance of baseline HRQOL as a significant and independent predictor of LRC in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.	Beyond tumor and nodal stage, Karnofsky performance status, primary site, cigarette use, use of concurrent chemotherapy, and altered fractionation schedules, the FACT-H&amp;N score was independently predictive of LRC (but not OS), with p = 0.0038.
__label__noRel	However, further research is needed to identify ways to improve the potency and sustainability of psychoeducational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue.	No significant differences were identified for any pre- or post-test change scores for confidence with managing fatigue, cancer self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, or quality of life.
__label__noRel	recovery was found at both 6 months and 1 year in both groups.	Patients in the NGT group reported significantly (P<0.05) better scores of QoL at both 6 months and 1 year.
__label__noRel	the toxicity-related death rate was 9% in the PCDE arm versus 5.5% in the EP arm (P =.22).	The global health status showed similar improvement in both arms during treatment.
__label__noRel	Prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 84% (146 of 173 men) in the radical prostatectomy group, 80% (122 of 153) in the watchful-waiting group, and 46% (95 of 208) in the control group and prevalence of urinary leakage was 41% (71 of 173), 11% (18 of 164), and 3% (six of 209), respectively.	For men in SPCG-4, negative side-effects were common and added more stress than was reported in the control population.
__label__noRel	After 6 weeks, patients taking prednisone showed no improvement in HQL scores, whereas those taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life (P =.009), four functioning domains, and nine symptoms (.001 < P <. 01),	only physical functioning and pain were better in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group.
__label__noRel	The added benefit of CMF followed by tamoxifen over tamoxifen alone was statistically significantly dependent on ER status (tests for interaction: P =.01 for disease-free survival [DFS] and P =.07 for overall survival [OS]).	By contrast, for patients with ER-positive tumors, addition of CMF provided no benefit in terms of DFS (5-year DFS = 84% for CMF-->tamoxifen versus 85% for tamoxifen alone; difference = -1; 95% CI = -6% to 4%; RR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.30; P =.92) or OS (5-year OS = 95% for CMF-->tamoxifen versus 93% for tamoxifen alone; difference = 2%; 95% CI = -1% to 5%; RR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.64 to 1.40; P =.80).
__label__noRel	but substantive differences in many symptom scores favored docetaxel.	After a median follow-up of 23 months, both groups had similar progression-free survival (medians of 15.0 months for docetaxel-carboplatin and 14.8 months for paclitaxel-carboplatin; hazard ratio [HR] docetaxel-paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), overall survival rates at 2 years (64.2% and 68.9%, respectively; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), and objective tumor (58.7% and 59.5%, respectively; difference between docetaxel and paclitaxel = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) and CA-125 (75.8% and 76.8%, respectively; difference docetaxel-paclitaxel = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794) response rates.
__label__noRel	Compared with the results obtained in the previous SIOP study, treatment in MMT84 was based on response to initial chemotherapy and, despite an overall reduction of the use of local therapy, significantly improved survival for patients with non-metastatic disease.	Complete remission was achieved in 91% (170/186) of all patients.
__label__noRel	The SF-6D score decreased to 21·2 ± 2·5 in the oxycodone/paracetamol group at the end of the phase (P = 0·001).	In the oxycodone/paracetamol group, 67% rated GI as good, very good, or excellent.
__label__noRel	Three treatment-related deaths occurred: 2 patients in the surgical arms (one late pulmonary toxicity and one pulmonary embolus), and 1 patient in the radiation arm (radiation pneumonitis).	histologic confirmation of N2 disease in the surgical and nonsurgical arms eliminated the usual biases from clinical staging.
__label__noRel	Bone metastases are a common cause of morbidity in patients with prostate carcinoma.

__label__noRel	Dermatitis is a frequent adverse effect of adjuvant breast radiotherapy.	Breast IMRT significantly improved the dose distribution compared with standard radiation.
__label__noRel	Although the change in fiber intake between the groups was not significant,	Intensive nutrition intervention following the ADA MNT protocol results in improved dietary intake compared with standard practice and seems to beneficially impact nutrition-related outcomes previously observed in oncology outpatients receiving radiotherapy.
__label__noRel	However, combination modalities including IPC and SLD may be the preferred choices for their applicability at home.	no significant difference (p=0.582) was found between those two groups.
__label__Support	Despite difficulties in carrying out and analysing QoL items in such patients, the global QoL evaluated by the Spitzer's questionnaire suggested an advantage for MVC regimen (P=0.05) and a significant difference was observed in global health subdomain (P=0.04).	The two chemotherapy regimen showed a similar effectiveness in symptom palliation when evaluated with C30 addendum of EORTC QOL questionnaire.
__label__Support	The 3-year overall survival for neoadjuvant versus control arm was 94.1% and 67.7% (hazard ratio = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.078 to 0.73; P = .012).	Preliminary results suggested a positive impact on survival.
__label__Support	Clinically relevant improvements in symptoms and mood disturbance were seen for both groups over the study period.	Improvements were seen for symptom scores over the study period.
__label__Support	With a median follow-up time of 12 months and 382 deaths, there was no clear survival benefit when comparing PCV with TMZ (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11; P = .350).	Although TMZ (both arms combined) did not show a clear benefit compared with PCV, comparison of the TMZ schedules demonstrated that the 21-day schedule was inferior to the 5-day schedule in this setting.
__label__Support	These effects remained when statistically controlling for baseline levels of distress, immunity, and health as well as sociodemographic, disease, and cancer treatment variables.	A path model revealed that intervention participation directly improved health (p<.05) at 12 months.
__label__Support	At radiotherapy completion, in G1 all QoL function scores improved proportionally to adequate intake or nutritional status (P < .05); whereas in G2 only three of six function scores improved proportionally to protein intake (P = .04), and in G3 all scores worsened (P < .05).	During radiotherapy, both interventions positively influenced outcomes;
__label__Attack	Patients who received the 800-mg/d dose fell between the low- and high-dose arms in reported intensity of drug side effects,	Unless additional follow-up data demonstrate a survival advantage at higher doses, the 160-mg/d dose is optimal, achieving maximal treatment effect with the fewest side effects and better quality of life.
__label__Support	No survival differences were noted.	The 3-hour infusion of Taxol is safe when given with premedication and is associated with less neutropenia.
__label__Attack	however, a trend for a positive response for the estramustine group was found in patients with grade III glioma.	In conclusion, this first randomized study did not demonstrate any significant improvement of using estramustine in addition to conventional radiotherapy,
__label__Support	Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P<.002).	Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer.
__label__Support	Patients overwhelmingly reported that CCSP was beneficial.	The CCSP as an effective coping intervention has potential as a self-management program for breast cancer survivors.
__label__Support	The 5-year biochemical +/- clinical relapse-free and overall survival was 55.9% and 85.3% respectively for all patients, and did not differ between the two schedules.	The hypofractionated schedule is equivalent in efficacy to the conventional schedule.
__label__Support	Adding E to G did not increase hematologic toxicities.	Data suggest that the GE combination may improve clinical outcomes.
__label__Support	Thirty-two patients receiving IFN5 and 19 patients receiving IFN1 experienced Grade 3 or higher adverse events (graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) (P = .025).	Compared with IFN5, IFN1 is neither more nor less effective but is less toxic, with a better reported QOL.
__label__Attack	However, DPPE is associated with unusual toxicity in the form of hallucinations, nausea and vomiting which were anticipated to impact on short-term quality of life (QOL).	DPPE (tesmilifene) plus doxorubicin (DOX) demonstrated a significant improvement in survival versus DOX in a phase III clinical trial in advanced breast cancer.
__label__Support	Similar results were found for low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa (84.3%) versus high-dose radioiodine plus thyroid hormone withdrawal (87.6%) or high-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa (90.2%).	Low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa was as effective as high-dose radioiodine, with a lower rate of adverse events.
__label__Attack	there was a trend in the anticipated direction (P=0.083).	The nutrition intervention group had a higher mean protein intake (1.1 to 1.3 g/kg/day) compared with the standard practice group (1.0 to 1.1 g/kg/day) (P=0.001).
__label__Support	Time to progression (TTP; primary end point) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were significantly longer with AT than AC (median TTP, 37.3 v 31.9 weeks; log-rank P =.014; median TTF, 25.6 v 23.7 weeks; log-rank P =.048).	AT significantly improves TTP and ORR compared with AC in patients with MBC,
__label__Support	The difference in mean volume change between randomisation groups at 12 months was not statistically significant (P = 0.6), -1.3% (95% CI -6.1 to 3.5), nor was there a significant difference in response at 6 months (P = 0.7), where mean change in arm volume from baseline in the treatment and placebo groups was -2.3% (95% CI -7.9 to 3.4) and -1.1% (95% CI -3.9 to 1.7), respectively.	The study fails to demonstrate efficacy of dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate plus pentoxifylline in patients with arm lymphoedema following axillary surgery and lymphatic radiotherapy, nor does it suggest any benefits of these drugs in radiation-induced induration (fibrosis) in the breast, chest wall, pectoral fold, axilla or supraclavicular fossa.
__label__Support	PFS was 11 months for HDCT and 9 months for ST (HR, 0.6 in favor of HDCT; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9; P = .006).	HDCT did not improve OS in women with MBC when used as consolidation after response to induction chemotherapy.
__label__Support	The final multivariate model for response selected DFI (P=0.009), multiple sites of visceral disease (P=0.037) and dyspnoea (P=<0.001) using forward selection,	patient-assessed QL variables appear to be prognostic for survival and response to chemotherapy in women with advanced breast cancer.
__label__Support	There was a significant interaction between gender and KPS using FLIC (P = 0.009), which also showed a trend toward significance with FACT (P = 0.09).	Results of this randomized study incorporating prospective QOL measurements suggested that in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, analyzing QOL data by either gender or performance status alone may not accurately reflect how these factors depend upon each another.
__label__Support	Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between groups at 90 days (P = .002)	Sleep quality differed over 1 years time (F [4,162] = 7.7, P < .001; by group, F [1,173] = 4.8, P = .029; and over time by group, F [4,162] = 3.3, P = .013).
__label__Support	Vinorelbine-treated patients scored better than control patients on QoL functioning scales, and they reported fewer lung cancer-related symptoms but reported worse toxicity-related symptoms.	Vinorelbine improves survival of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC and possibly improves overall QoL.
__label__Attack	but the study was not designed to detect differences in these parameters.	The 3-weekly irinotecan schedule also seemed advantageous in terms of grade 3/4 diarrhea, time to progression, overall survival and patient convenience,
__label__Attack	the change did not meet the clinically relevant threshold.	Although improvements in the UC group occurred by 12-months post-surgery,
__label__Attack	However, modifications are needed in future randomized trials to reduce the rate of premature termination and to improve long-term maintenance of gains.	The results of this brief pilot counseling intervention demonstrated significant gains in sexual function and satisfaction and increased utilization of treatments for ED.
__label__Attack	Larger studies should be carried out that also include healthy women who want to avoid hormone replacement therapy.	but results from this preliminary trial suggest that homeopathy may be of value in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and improving quality of life, especially in those women not on tamoxifen.
__label__Attack	However, a trend for more favorable overall survival was documented in the PLD arm compared with the GEM arm,	No statistically significant difference in time to progression (TTP) curves according to treatment allocation was documented (P = .411).
__label__Attack	However, the magnitude of this difference was not helpful in defining which patients were likely to respond.	Pretreatment serum erythropoietin levels were lower in responders than in nonresponders (73.5 IU/L and 86.3 IU/L means, respectively).
__label__Attack	but the adverse reactions decreased significantly in the PP group compared with those in the GP group.	The clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin for the treatment of previously untreated advanced NSCLC was roughly the same,
__label__Attack	but this did not appear to be an important issue to the patients.	Cosmetic results were better in those not receiving radiotherapy
__label__Attack	but the low compliance does not allow to draw definitive conclusions.	At 6 months after the end of RT, global HRQOL was higher in the TPF arm than in the PF arm,
__label__Attack	except for hair loss.	No significant differences were seen in favour of the supportive care group,
__label__Attack	although the difference did not attain statistical significance.	Median overall survival and progression-free survival were more favorable in the combination arm as compared with gemcitabine alone,
__label__Attack	an advantage which did not, however, reach statistical significance (HR = 0.80; P = .15).	Also, median overall survival was superior for patients treated in the GemCis arm as compared with the Gem arm (7.5 v 6.0 months),
__label__Attack	but responded similarly to those in the 160-mg/d group in terms of physical functioning, psychologic distress, and overall quality of life.	Patients who received the 800-mg/d dose fell between the low- and high-dose arms in reported intensity of drug side effects,
__label__Attack	although trends were seen in favour of the chemotherapy group.	Group differences were smaller within the psychosocial domain,
__label__Attack	but these changes became insignificant 2 years after treatment.	Surgery was associated with a short-term negative impact in some aspects of health related quality of life assessments
__label__Attack	but late complications were more frequent after rigid stenting (risk ratio=2.47; 95% CI 1.88-3.04).	There were no differences in the in-hospital mortality or early complication rates,
