__label__noRel	Patients treated with early alternating chemotherapy rated their tumor symptoms, functional states, fatigue/malaise and restriction of social activity significantly better, reflecting an improved subjective adjustment.	The overall remission rate was 87% with 31% complete remissions.
__label__noRel	Mean dominant fibroid diameter was 7.6 ± 3.0, 5.8 ± 2.9, and 5 ± 2.9 cm at baseline, 6 months, and 5 years.	In the UAE group, mean ± standard deviation uterine volume was 670 ± 503, 422 ± 353, and 292 ± 287 mL at baseline, 6 months, and 5 years, respectively.
__label__noRel	At 3 months, group 1 maintained intakes, whereas groups 2 and 3 returned to or below baseline levels.	During RT, nutritional interventions positively influenced outcomes, and counseling was of similar/higher benefit;
__label__noRel	The randomized controlled double-blind HECTOR trial showed no survival benefit for HCC patients treated with long-acting octreotide compared with placebo.	Six-month survival rates were 41% for octreotide patients and 42% for control patients, respectively.
__label__noRel	Relapse after completing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy is a persistent threat for women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.	At a median follow-up of 30 months, letrozole significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.001), the primary end point, compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or contralateral breast cancer 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45, 0.76] P<0.001).
__label__noRel	although the exercise and control group means were significantly different (P <.001).	Participation in an upper-body exercise program caused no changes in arm circumference or arm volume in women with lymphedema after breast cancer, and they may have experienced an increase in quality of life.
__label__noRel	Patients treated with postoperative RT had better function with higher MSTS (25.8 v 21.3, P <.01), TESS (69.8 v 60.6, P =.01), and SF-36 bodily pain (67.7 v 58.5, P =.03) scores at 6 weeks after surgery.	Tumor characteristics and wound complications have a detrimental effect on patient function.
__label__noRel	Grade 3 hypertension was more common with bevacizumab treatment (16% v 3%)	duration of response was 9.2 months (FU/LV/bevacizumab) and 6.8 months (FU/LV/placebo);
__label__noRel	The TC regimen achieved comparable efficacy to the PT regimen but was associated with better tolerability and quality of life, and should, therefore, be considered as an important alternative for standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.	Median progression-free survival time in the TC arm (17.2 months, 95% CI = 15.2 to 19.3 months) and the PT arm (19.1 months, 95% CI = 16.7 to 21.5 months) were also not statistically significantly different;
__label__noRel	but it remained unclear whether this combination is more effective than IFNalpha alone in patients with metastatic melanoma.	The addition of isotretinoin to an adjuvant treatment of low-dose IFNalpha in patients with stage IIA and IIB melanoma had no significant effect on disease-free or overall survival and is therefore not recommended.

__label__noRel	Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer.	The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older.
__label__noRel	The patient accrual to this trial made its results inconclusive,	No difference in the 1-year survival rate (70% vs. 66%) or median survival time (19.4 vs. 17.4 months) between the surgery and RT arms.
__label__Support	Fat mass had significantly decreased by month 12 in the exemestane, but not in the tamoxifen group;	Our findings suggest that switching patients to adjuvant exemestane treatment after at least 2 years of tamoxifen therapy may be associated with an advantage over continuing adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in terms of body composition.
__label__Support	Initial costs were higher for GJJ compared to stent placement (euro8315 vs. euro4820, P < 0.001).	although GJJ had higher total costs.
__label__Support	There was no significant difference in scores at months 9 and 12 (P = .24 and P = .93, respectively).	Patients who performed prophylactic swallowing exercises had improved swallowing function at 3 and 6 months after CRT but not immediately after CRT or at 9 and 12 months after CRT.
__label__Support	Median PFS was 5.5 months in both arms (HR, 1.04; P = .727), while ORR was 25% in both arms (P = 1.0).	The addition of ASA404 to carboplatin and paclitaxel, although generally well tolerated, failed to improve frontline efficacy in advanced NSCLC.
__label__Support	Resorption markers did not decrease after placebo,	The new bone resorption markers of collagen breakdown were able to predict clinical response to pamidronate.
__label__Support	No QOL differences were noted between arms.	Data suggest that the GE combination may improve clinical outcomes.
__label__Support	At week 12, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An; mean, 2.16 +/- 12.84 for epoetin alfa v -4.43 +/- 13.42 for SOC) and FACT-An fatigue (mean, 1.85 +/- 10.52 for epoetin alfa v -3.55 +/- 11.14 for SOC) change scores were significantly higher in the epoetin alfa group (P < .0001).	Epoetin alfa administered at 40,000 U qw is effective in improving QOL, maintaining hemoglobin level, and reducing transfusion requirements in breast cancer patients.
__label__Support	There was a significant improvement in physical functioning (coefficient, 10.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-17.5; P = .009), and this effect remained once the confounding effects of mood disturbance and comorbid disorders were controlled statistically.	The behaviorally oriented intervention brought about significant improvements in physical functioning, indicated a trend toward improved CRF, but detected no effect for fatigue-related distress.
__label__Support	A model measuring effectiveness of CCSP on QOL (total and subscale) at 1-year follow-up showed that the CCSP group (n = 38) had significant improvement in overall QOL (p < 0.01), health and functioning (p < 0.05), and socioeconomic (p < 0.05) and psychological/spiritual well-being (p < 0.01) compared with the control group (n = 35).	The CCSP as an effective coping intervention has potential as a self-management program for breast cancer survivors.
__label__Support	With a mixed modeling approach, total FACIT F scores for the entire sample declined at a significant rate (p = 0.003) beginning with cycle 3	Seated exercise may be a feasible exercise program for women with advanced cancer for controlling fatigue and improving physical well-being.
__label__Support	The major World Health Organization grade 3-4 toxicities for NP and NIP, respectively, were: neutropenia (20.3% compared with 9% of cycles), anaemia (4.1% compared with 5% of cycles), nausea and vomiting (22.2% compared with 19.4% of patients) and alopecia (5.6% compared with 29.8% of patients).	This confirms that the two-drug combination NP is a reference treatment for metastatic NSCLC.
__label__Support	Regarding the QoL investigation, the scores of QoL dropped for all patients at 3 weeks after surgery.	Patients who underwent gastric tube reconstruction develop less postoperative digestive tract complications, and have a quicker recovery and a better QoL during the follow-up period.
__label__Support	The intervention also improved all other fatigue aspects measured by MFI, including Physical Fatigue and Mental Fatigue (acupuncture effect, -2.36 and -1.94, respectively; both at P < .001), anxiety and depression (acupuncture effect, -1.83 and -2.13, respectively; both at P < .001), and quality of life (Physical Well-Being effect, 3.30; Functional Well-Being effect, 3.57; both at P < .001; Emotional Well-Being effect, 1.93; P = .001; and Social Functioning Well-Being effect, 1.05; P < .05).	Acupuncture is an effective intervention for managing the symptom of CRF and improving patients' quality of life.
__label__Support	No evidence of a difference was observed between the two treatment groups in terms of activity level, anxiety, depression, and psychological distress, as recorded by the patients.	In minimally symptomatic patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, no persuasive evidence was found to indicate that giving immediate palliative thoracic radiotherapy improves symptom control, quality of life, or survival when compared with delaying until symptoms require treatment.
__label__Support	Older adult patients reported better overall QOL (LASA 74.4 vs. 62.9, p = 0.040), higher social well-being (FACT-G 91.1 vs. 83.3, p = 0.045), and fewer problems with anger (POMS anger-hostility 95.0 vs. 86.4, p = 0.028).	Older adult patients who received a multidisciplinary intervention to improve QOL while undergoing advanced cancer treatments benefited differently in some QOL domains, compared to younger adult patients.
__label__Support	Adding E to G did not increase hematologic toxicities.	Data suggest that the GE combination may improve clinical outcomes.
__label__Support	However, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the high-dose group (19 v 14 weeks; P = .02).	The 3-hour infusion of Taxol is safe when given with premedication and is associated with less neutropenia.
__label__Attack	However, combination modalities including IPC and SLD may be the preferred choices for their applicability at home.	Different treatment modalities consisting of MLD and compression bandage(complex decongestive therapy) or IPC and SLD appear to be effective in the treatment of LE with similar therapeutic efficacy in patients with breast cancer.
__label__Support	Food intake improved more rapidly after stent placement than after GJJ (GOO Scoring System score > or = 2: median 5 vs 8 days, respectively; P < .01)	Because stent placement was associated with better short-term outcomes,
__label__Support	Among the 17 participants with depressive symptoms at baseline, both the Onward and the III-only condition showed large reductions in the depression scale of HADS (d = 1.27 and 0.89, respectively).	Both the III + ISG and III-only demonstrated pre-post reductions in depressive symptoms and high rates of utilization compared with other web-based treatments for depression.
__label__Support	Between-group differences in the primary outcomes were not significant at 12 months,	A peer-modeling videotape can accelerate the recovery of energy during the re-entry phase in women treated for breast cancer, particularly among those who feel less prepared for re-entry.
__label__Attack	The costs during the follow-up period did not differ between the two groups.	The results of this randomized clinical trial indicate that daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside plus GM-CSF is not a cost-effective treatment strategy when compared with daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside alone.
__label__Attack	but it was not statistically significant ($4700 versus $6453, difference = $1753, 95% CI on the difference = -$99 to $3604; P =.06).	The estimated difference in total societal costs was larger, also in favor of the single-fraction schedule,
__label__Attack	The total efficacy of non-squamous cell carcinoma in the PP group was significantly higher than that in GP group.	The clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin for the treatment of previously untreated advanced NSCLC was roughly the same,
__label__Attack	but they reported no other effects.	At 4-month follow-up, intervention patients reported less uncertainty and better communication with spouses than control patients,
__label__Attack	Research is needed to assess the long term risks and benefits of starting hormone replacement therapy near the menopause, when the effect may be different.	Hormone replacement therapy increases cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk when started many years after the menopause.
__label__Attack	However, presuming these improvements were caused by the individualized homeopathic approach, the study failed to show clearly that the specific effect of the remedy added further to the nonspecific effects of the consultation.	Improvements were seen for symptom scores over the study period.
__label__Attack	the change did not meet the clinically relevant threshold.	Although improvements in the UC group occurred by 12-months post-surgery,
__label__Attack	but this was not associated with increased hospital admission or fatality.	More thrombocytopenia occurred with GCa (P = .03),
__label__Attack	PVI 5-FU + MMC caused more overall haematological toxicity but CTC grades 3/4 was increased only for thrombocytopaenia.	PVI 5-FU + MMC results in failure-free survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity and better QL when compared to PVI 5-FU alone but no overall survival advantage.
__label__Attack	but responded similarly to those in the 160-mg/d group in terms of physical functioning, psychologic distress, and overall quality of life.	Patients who received the 800-mg/d dose fell between the low- and high-dose arms in reported intensity of drug side effects,
__label__Attack	yet patients in the experimental group showed a significant increase in the use of PRN analgesics and nonpharmacological strategies to relieve pain (P < .05) and significantly reduce barriers to managing their cancer pain (P < .05) compared with the control group.	Upon the completion of PMP, pain scores were significantly reduced in both groups,
__label__Attack	but substantive differences in many symptom scores favored docetaxel.	Global quality of life was similar in both arms,
__label__Attack	the eventual cost-effectiveness will only become clear after long-term follow-up.	Extrapolations from these data suggest that radiotherapy may not be a cost-effective treatment unless it results in a recurrence rate that is at least 5% lower in absolute terms than those treated without radiotherapy.
__label__Attack	no group effects were found.	Fatigue was lower at 1 year than before CTX;
__label__Attack	although longer follow-up is required for a definitive statement on survival.	Docetaxel-carboplatin appears to be similar to paclitaxel-carboplatin in terms of progression-free survival and response,
__label__Attack	The sample size was small, and patients applied a small amount of imiquimod 5% cream (half a sachet) to a large surface area.	There was no statistically significant difference in effect on quality of life as assessed using the DLQI.
__label__Attack	but the difference was not statistically significant (GE 15.5%, GP 27.7%, p = 0.20).	The rate of grade 2 or above nausea was numerically higher in the GP arm,
__label__Attack	There is a need for further studies so that its effect can be confirmed.	Pilates exercises are effective and safe in female breast cancer patients.
